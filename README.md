#  ML-Powered Chatbot

A simple yet powerful **machine learningâ€“based chatbot** that understands user messages and responds intelligently using **intent classification**.
This bot is trained on the `intents.csv` dataset and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** for an interactive web experience.

---

##  Features

* Trained using **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**
* Classifies user queries into predefined **intents**
* Responds contextually using a predefined response dictionary
* Built with **Streamlit** for easy web deployment
* Expandable â€” you can add new intents anytime

---

##  How It Works

1. **Training**

   * The chatbot learns patterns from the dataset (`intents.csv`)
   * It uses TF-IDF for text feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification

2. **Prediction**

   * User input is vectorized and passed to the model
   * The predicted intent determines which response to show

3. **Response Generation**

   * Responses are stored in `intents_responses.py`
   * The bot selects a random response from the predicted intentâ€™s list

##  Project Structure

```
ml_chatbot/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                   # Streamlit chatbot app  
â”œâ”€â”€ train_model.py           # Script to train and save the model  
â”œâ”€â”€ model/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clf.pkl              # Trained ML model  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vectorizer.pkl       # TF-IDF vectorizer  
â”œâ”€â”€ intents.csv              # Dataset (intents and user messages)  
â”œâ”€â”€ intents_responses.py     # Intent â†’ responses mapping  
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Dependencies  
```

##  Dataset (intents.csv)

| text           | intent   |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Hello          | greeting |
| Hi there       | greeting |
| Bye            | goodbye  |
| Thank you      | thanks   |
| Tell me a joke | joke     |

---

##  Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-chatbot.git
cd ml-chatbot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Training the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will generate two files in the `model/` folder:

* `clf.pkl` â†’ Trained Logistic Regression model
* `vectorizer.pkl` â†’ TF-IDF vectorizer

---

##  Running the Chatbot

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local URL shown (or deploy to Streamlit Cloud).

---

##  Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push this project to your **GitHub** repo.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
3. Click **New App â†’ Connect your repo**.
4. Select `app.py` as the main file.
5. Click **Deploy**.

Your ML chatbot is now live! ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ§© Requirements

```
streamlit
scikit-learn
pandas
```

---

##  Future Improvements

* Add more intents to `intents.csv`
* Use deep learning (BERT / DistilBERT) for better understanding
* Store chat history in a database
* Add speech input/output

Would you like me to make it slightly **shorter and more aesthetic (for GitHub)** with emojis, badges, and a preview image section?
